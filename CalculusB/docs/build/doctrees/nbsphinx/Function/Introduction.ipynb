    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"chapter\" I will attempt to run through some required function knowledge for calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural world is full of relationships between quantities that change. When we see these relationships, it is natural for us to ask \"If I know one quantity, can I then determine the other?\" This establishes the idea of an input quantity, or independent variable, and a corresponding output quantity, or dependent variable. From this we get the notion of a functional relationship in which the output can be determined from the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some quantities, like height and age, there are certainly relationships between these quantities. Given a specific person and any age, it is easy enough to determine their height, but if we tried to reverse that relationship and determine height from a given age, that would be problematic, since most people maintain the same height for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Definition of a Function\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A **function** is rule for a relationship between an input, or independent, quantity and an output, or dependent, quantity in which each input value uniquely determines one output value. We say \"the output is a function of the input.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some things to consider:\n",
    "* In the height and age example above, is height a function of age? Is age a function of height?\n",
    "* In the height and age example above, it would be correct to say that height is a function of age, since each age uniquely determines a height. For example, on my 18th birthday, I had exactly one height of 69 inches.\n",
    "* However, age is not a function of height, since one height input might correspond with more than one output age. For example, for an input height of 70 inches, there is more than one output of age since I was 70 inches at the age of 20 and 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify writing out expressions and equations involving functions, a simplified notation is often used. We also use descriptive variables to help us remember the meaning of the quantities in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than write \"height is a function of age,\" we could use the descriptive variable h to represent height and we could use the descriptive variable a to represent age.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Height is a function of age\". If we name the function $f$ we\n",
    "write \"$h\\text{ is }f\\text{ of }a$\", or more simply $h=f(a)$. We \n",
    "could instead name the function $h$ and write $h(a)$ which is read \"$h$ of $a$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we can use any variable to name the function; the notation\n",
    "$h(a)$ shows us that $h$ depends on $a$. The value \"$a$\"\n",
    "must be put into the function \"$h$\" to\n",
    "get a result. Be careful -- the parentheses indicate that age is\n",
    "input into the function (Note: do not confuse these parentheses with\n",
    "multiplication!).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The notation output = $f(\\text{input})$ defines a function name $f$.\n",
    "This would be read \"output is $f$ of input\".\n",

    "which is a value for the input quantity of the function, the year,\n",
    "$y$. The output value is $300$, the number of police officers, $N$,\n",
    "a value for the output quantity. Remember $N=f(y)$. So this tells\n",

    "\n",
    "Functions can be represented in many ways: Words (as we did in the\n",
    "last few examples), tables of values, graphs, or formulas. Represented\n",
    "as a table, we are presented with a list of input and output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table represents the age of children in years and their corresponding\n",

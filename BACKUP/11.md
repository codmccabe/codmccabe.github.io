1.1 Functions and Their Graphs {#functions-and-their-graphs .unnumbered}
==============================

A **function** $f$ is a rule of correspondence that associates with each
element $x$ in one set $D$, called the **domain**, a $single$ value
$f(x)$ from a second set, $R$. The set of all values so obtained is
called the **range** of the function.

Odd, Even, Increasing, and Decreasing.
--------------------------------------

Â 

-   If $f(-x)=f(x)$ for all $x$, then the graph is symmetric with
    respect to the $y$-axis. Such a function is called an **even
    function.**

-   If $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all $x$, then the graph is symmetric with
    respect to the origin. Such a function is called an **odd
    function.**

We say $f(x)=x^{2}$ is an even function, and $f(x)=x^{3}$ is an odd
function.

Two very important characteristics of functions are described in the
following definition.

A function $f$ is called **increasing** on an interval $I$ if for all
$x_{1},x_{2}\in I$ $$x_{1}<x_{2}\implies f(x_{1})<f(x_{2}).$$ It is
called **decreasing** on $I$ if for all $x_{1},x_{2}\in I$
$$x_{1}<x_{2}\implies f(x_{1})>f(x_{2}).$$

Power Function and Variations
-----------------------------

A function whose graph is described as a line is called a **linear
function**. Algebraically denoted $$f(x)=mx+b=a_{1}x+a_{0}.$$

To expand from the previous definition we recall the following important
definition.

A function $P$ is called a **polynomial** if
$$P(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}$$ where
$n$ is a non-negative integer and the numbers $a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{n}$
are constants called the **coefficients** of the polynomial. The domain
of any polynomial is
$\mathbb{R}=\left\{ x\,|\,x\in(-\infty,\infty)\right\}$. If the leading
coefficient $a_{n}\ne0$, then the degree of the polynomial is $n$.

Named Polynomials:

-   A polynomial of degree 1 is called a **linear function**.

-   A polynomial of degree 2 is called a **quadratic function**.

-   A polynomial of degree 3 is called a **cubic function**.

A function of the form $$f(x)=x^{a}$$ where $a$ is a real number is
called a **power function**.

-   If $a=1,2,3,...$ we have polynomials. The graph of any polynomial is
    generated from these polynomials through translations.

-   If $a=\frac{1}{n}$ where $n=1,2,3,...$ then we say
    $$f(x)=x^{a}=x^{\frac{1}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{x}$$ is a **root function**.

    -   For $n$ even the domain of $f$ is
        $\left\{ x\,|\,x\in[0,\infty)\right\}$.

    -   For $n$ odd the domain of $f$ is
        $\left\{ x\,|\,x\in\mathbb{R}\right\}$.

-   If $a=-1,-2,-3,...$then we say $$f(x)=x^{a}=\frac{1}{x^{-a}}$$ is a
    **reciprocal function**. For example, $a=-1$ we have
    $$f(x)=x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x^{-(-1)}}=\frac{1}{x^{1}}=\frac{1}{x}.$$

-   If $a=0$ then we say $$f(x)=x^{0}=1$$ is the **constant function**.

A function that is constructed by many power functions through algebraic
operations is called and **algebraic function.**

Piece-wise Defined Functions
----------------------------

The absolute value function $$|x|=\begin{cases}
x & \text{if \ensuremath{x\ge0}}\\
-x & \text{if \ensuremath{x<0}}
\end{cases}$$

Given $$f(x):=\begin{cases}
x^{2} & x<0\\
5 & x=0\\
\dfrac{1}{x} & x>0
\end{cases}$$

1.  Find $f(1)$.

2.  Find $f(0)$.

3.  Find $f(-1)$.

Least Integer Function "Floor Function".

Let $n$ be an integer and let $n\le x\le n+1$. Then we say
$\lfloor x\rfloor=n$.

Greatest Integer Function "Ceiling Function".

Let $n$ be an integer and let $n\le x\le n+1$. Then we say
$\lceil x\rceil=n+1$.

Find the floor and ceiling function value:

-   Find $\lfloor6.3\rfloor$

-   Find $\lceil8.1\rceil$

Trigonometric Functions
-----------------------

A function $f(x)$ is periodic if there is a positive number $p$ such
that $f(x+p)=f(x)$ for every value $x$. The smallest such value of $p$
is the period of $f$.

The period for $\tan(x)$ and $\cot(x)$ is $\pi$. The period for
$\cos(x)$, $\sin(x)$, and their reciprocal functions is $2\pi$.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
-------------------------------------

A function of the form $f(x)=a^{x}$, where $a>0$ and $a\ne1$, is called
an exponential function with base $a$.

![image](images/exp_graphs)

A function of the form $f(x)=\log_{a}(x)$, where $a\ne1$ and $a>0$, is
called a logarithmic function "log base a of x".

Transcendental functions are functions that are not algebraic, they
include trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and
logarithmic functions.
